Please do not add your style rules in this file.
They will be over-written with the inline styles
in your app. The compiler removes all inline styles
automatically and replace them with css class names.
The style rules for each class name is placed here in 
this file. See https://github.com/KBismark/remove-style
repo for how this feature works.
